## PhD Home 

Hello! My name is Owain Harris, and I am in my second year of the Environmental Intelligence CDT at Exeter Univeristy, and in my first year of undertaking my PhD. For my project, I am looking at high impact weather in the mid-latitude regions by studying dry intrusions in extratropical cyclones and frontal systems using machine learning methods. My supervisors are Dr Jennifer Catto and Dr Stefan Siegert from the Mathematics department.
